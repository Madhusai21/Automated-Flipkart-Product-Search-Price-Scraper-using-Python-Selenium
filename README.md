# Automated-Flipkart-Product-Search-Price-Scraper-using-Python-Selenium
#Excited to share my latest automation project! ðŸŽ‰

I built a Python + Selenium automation script that:

 âœ… Launches Flipkart in a browser

 âœ… Searches for iPhones automatically

 âœ… Extracts product names and their prices

 âœ… Prints results in a clean format

 âœ… Validates the page title to ensure correct navigation



#This project helped me practice:

1.Web automation with Selenium WebDriver

2.Explicit waits using WebDriverWait and expected_conditions

3.Dynamic element handling with XPath and attributes

4.Validation testing by checking page titles



Itâ€™s a small step, but it shows how automation can save time in extracting online product data effortlessly. ðŸš€
